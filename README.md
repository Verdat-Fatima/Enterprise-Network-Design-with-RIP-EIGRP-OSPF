# Enterprise-Network-Design-with-RIP-EIGRP-OSPF
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a full-scale enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective was to configure and integrate different routing protocols including RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF, and to enable inter-protocol communication through redistribution on Router 13, which serves as the central redistribution point. The network consists of fourteen routers (R1â€“R14), divided into three autonomous domains, and is designed using subnetting for efficient IP addressing. Additional configurations include the setup of a DHCP server for automatic IP assignment, an Email Server to simulate communication between users, and a Web Server for testing accessibility. Security and control were implemented through Access Control Lists (ACL), while Network Address Translation (NAT) was configured to manage communication between private and public networks. Connectivity was tested through ping commands and email exchange between different PCs across domains, confirming that RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP networks successfully communicated with each other. This project was developed and tested on Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.2.0400, and it is recommended to use the same or a newer version for full compatibility.
